USER: How do I impliment this?

USER: can you give me a simple step-by-step plan, including any code and configurations I would need to read the documents within the library, copy them to a new folder and assign them the naming convention I had mentioned?

USER: give me a more detailed step by step instruction of how to do this.

SNUFFLES: Sure, I can provide you with a more detailed step-by-step plan for reading documents within your library, copying them to a new folder, and assigning them the naming convention you mentioned. 
First, you will need to create a SharePoint list or library to store your documents. To do this, you will need to log into your SharePoint site and click on the Lists and Libraries tab. From there, you can select the Create option and choose the type of list or library you would like to create. 
Once you have created the list or library, you can create a SharePoint workflow to automatically rename files according to the naming convention. To do this, you will need to click on the Workflows tab and select the Create option. From there, you can choose the type of workflow you would like to create and configure it to include the LEVEL, AREA, EntityType, DocType, Entity, and Date criteria. 
Next, you will need to use a combination of SharePoint views, metadata, and search to organize and categorize your documents. To do this, you will need to click on the Views tab and select the Create option. From there, you can choose the type of view you would like to create and configure it to organize and filter your documents according to the different criteria in your naming convention. Additionally, you can use SharePoint metadata to further organize and categorize your documents. To do this, you will need to click on the Metadata tab and select the Create option. From there, you can choose the type of metadata you would like to create and configure it to further organize and categorize your documents. Finally, you can use SharePoint search to quickly find documents based on keywords or phrases. To do this, you will need to click on the

USER: Where does the OCR step occur?

SNUFFLES: The OCR step occurs after you have organized and categorized your documents. Once you have done this, you can use a free OCR tool, such as Microsoft Office Document Imaging (MODI) or Google Drive OCR, to convert the scanned documents into editable text. This will allow you to easily copy the documents to a new folder and assign them the naming convention you mentioned. To use the OCR tool, you will need to upload the scanned documents to the tool and then select the option to convert the documents into editable text. Once the documents have been converted, you can then copy them to a new folder and assign them the naming convention you mentioned.
