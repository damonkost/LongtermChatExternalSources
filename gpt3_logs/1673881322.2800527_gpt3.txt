USER: How do I impliment this?

USER: can you give me a simple step-by-step plan, including any code and configurations I would need to read the documents within the library, copy them to a new folder and assign them the naming convention I had mentioned?

USER: give me a more detailed step by step instruction of how to do this.

USER: Where does the OCR step occur?

USER: Where can I download this and will any common admin settings prevent me from installing the sharepoint tool?

USER: is there another method that would not require these permissions?

USER: What should I do today?

USER: write me a python program that imports my google calendar to a text file

SNUFFLES: Writing a program to import your Google calendar to a text file is certainly doable. To do this, you will need to use the Google Calendar API as well as the Python programming language. First, you will need to gather the authentication credentials for the Google Calendar API. These credentials will give your program access to the data stored inside the Google Calendar. Next, you will have to set up the Python program by importing the libraries and modules that you need. After that, you will have to initiate the connection between the program and the Google Calendar API. Then, you will use the API's methods to extract the desired data from the calendar. Finally, you will need to use Python commands to write the calendar data to a text file. Please let me know if you have any further questions.

SNUFFLES: Sure! Here are the steps and Python code you need to write a program to import your Google Calendar to a text file:
1. Gather authentication credentials for the Google Calendar API. These credentials will give your program access to the data stored inside the Google Calendar.
2. Set up the Python program by importing the libraries and modules that you need. This includes importing the Google Calendar API library.
3. Initiate the connection between the program and the Google Calendar API.
4. Use the API's methods to extract the desired data from the calendar.
5. Use Python commands to write the calendar data to a text file.
Here is a sample of the Python code you would need to do this:
import requests
import json
# enter your API credentials
client_id = "<your_client_id>"
client_secret = "<your_client_secret>"
# use the OAuth2 protocol to authorization
oauth2_url = 'https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token'
payload = {
 'client_id': client_id,
 'client_secret': client_secret,
 'grant_type': 'authorization_code'
}
response = requests.post(oauth2_url, data=payload)
token = response.json()['access_token']
# create a connection to the Google Calendar API
api_url='https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3'
headers = { 'Authorization': 'Bearer {}'.format(token) }
# retrieve the calendar events
events_url = api_url + '/calendars/primary/events'
events_response = requests.get(events_url, headers=headers)
events_data = events_response.json()
events = events_data['items']
# write calendar events to a text file
with open('calendar-events.txt', 'w') as f:
 for event in events:
 line = '{}: {}\n'.format(event['start']['dateTime'],event['summary'])
 f.write(line)
I hope this was helpful! Please let me know if you have any further questions.
