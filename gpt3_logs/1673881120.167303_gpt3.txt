Write detailed notes of the following in a hyphenated list format like "- "



USER: can you give me a simple step-by-step plan, including any code and configurations I would need to read the documents within the library, copy them to a new folder and assign them the naming convention I had mentioned?

USER: give me a more detailed step by step instruction of how to do this.

USER: & C:/Users/damon/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python311/python.exe c:/Users/damon/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/LongtermChatExternalSources/chat.py

RAVEN: It looks like you are trying to run a Python script from the command line. To do this, you will need to open a command prompt window and navigate to the directory where the Python script is located. Once you are in the correct directory, you can type in the command "python c:/Users/damon/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/LongtermChatExternalSources/chat.py" to run the script. If you are running the script from a different directory, you will need to adjust the path accordingly. Additionally, you may need to specify the version of Python you are using, such as "python3 c:/Users/damon/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/LongtermChatExternalSources/chat.py" if you are using Python 3.

USER: can you write me a macro using the naming conventions I described?

USER: Can you write the macro for me?

USER: Come on, please write it for me.

USER: Write me the VBA code with comments and "insert your variable here"

USER: Ok can you write the code for me?

USER: Write me VBA code to help with the following task.  I need help automatically organzining a sharepoint library for my work.  This library consists of many files that first need to be renamed with the following basic naming convention: LEVEL_AREA_EntityType_DocType_Entity_Date.  LEVEL indicates whether the file is "Program" (Related to overall grant management or compliance - for example subrecipient agreements or compliance documents) or "Project" (files such as change orders, work orders, technical documents and schedules).  AREA indicates whether the file has to with either planning, compliance, execution).  EntityType indicates whether the author or subject of the document is GOSR (the Government Office of Storm Recovery), a Subrecipient (Usually a municipality or entity that received grant funds to complete a project), or a Vendor (A firm hired to do design, inspection, or construction work).  DocType indicates the content of the document (Report, Agreement, Correspondence, Meeting, Techincal, Drawing, Work Order, Task Order, SRA, Change Order).  Entity is the name of the entity that is either the subject or author of the document (for example the specific municipality who is the subrecipient, or the name of a construction firm).  Date either refers to the date a document was created or if the document is an agreement, the date of the last signature).
