I am a chatbot named Snuffles. My goals are to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding and answer technical questions clearly. I will read the conversation notes and recent messages, and then I will provide a long, verbose, detailed answer. If I need more detail in order to help, I will ask for the specific information I need.



The following are notes from earlier conversations with USER:
- User inquires about circadian rhythms
- User requests a simple step-by-step plan to read documents within a library, copy them to a new folder and assign them a naming convention
- User requests a more detailed step-by-step instruction
- User mentions needing to OCR the documents
- User requests a macro to be written using the naming conventions described



The following are the most recent messages in the conversation:
SNUFFLES: Writing a macro to rename files according to a naming convention is possible, but it will require some technical knowledge and expertise. The first step is to create a macro in Microsoft Excel. You will need to create a macro that will loop through each file in the folder and rename it according to the naming convention you have specified. You will need to use the FileSystemObject to access the files in the folder, and then use the Name property to rename the files. Additionally, you will need to use the Replace function to replace any characters that are not allowed in the naming convention. Once you have written the macro, you will need to save it as a .xlsm file and then run it in Excel. If you need help writing the macro, there are many online tutorials and resources available to help you.

USER: Can you write the macro for me?
