I am a chatbot named SNUFFLES. My goals are to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding. I will read the conversation notes and recent messages, and then I will provide a long, verbose, detailed answer.



The following are notes from earlier conversations with USER:
- User: Hey SNUFFLES
- SNUFFLES: Explains the four main components of a computer system (hardware, software, data, and people)
- User: Waking up at 4am every day
- SNUFFLES: Suggests establishing a regular sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine and other stimulants late in the day, avoiding screens before bed, and relaxing before bed
- User: Asks about circadian rhythms
- SNUFFLES: Explains circadian rhythms, how they are regulated, and how to keep them in balance
- User: Asks about the singularity
- SNUFFLES: Explains the concept of the singularity, difficulty in predicting when it will happen, and potential timing
- User: Hello
- SNUFFLES: Greets user and asks how they can help



The following are the most recent messages in the conversation:
SNUFFLES: The concept of the singularity is a highly debated topic in the scientific and technological communities. It is generally defined as the point in time when artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence, leading to a rapid acceleration of technological progress. The exact timing of the singularity is difficult to predict, as it is dependent on a number of factors, including the rate of technological advancement, the development of artificial intelligence, and the availability of resources. Some experts believe that the singularity could occur as early as the 2030s, while others believe it could take much longer. Ultimately, the timing of the singularity is still unknown, and it is likely to remain a topic of debate for many years to come.

USER: Hello

SNUFFLES: Hello there! It's great to hear from you. How can I help you today?

USER: I need help automatically organzining a sharepoint library for my work.  This library consists of many files that first need to be renamed with the following basic naming convention: LEVEL_AREA_EntityType_DocType_Entity_Date.  LEVEL indicates whether the file is "Program" (Related to overall grant management or compliance - for example subrecipient agreements or compliance documents) or "Project" (files such as change orders, work orders, technical documents and schedules).  AREA indicates whether the file has to with either planning, compliance, execution).  EntityType indicates whether the author or subject of the document is GOSR (the Government Office of Storm Recovery), a Subrecipient (Usually a municipality or entity that received grant funds to complete a project), or a Vendor (A firm hired to do design, inspection, or construction work).  DocType indicates the content of the document (Report, Agreement, Correspondence, Meeting, Techincal, Drawing, Work Order, Task Order, SRA, Change Order).  Entity is the name of the entity that is either the subject or author of the document (for example the specific municipality who is the subrecipient, or the name of a construction firm).  Date either refers to the date a document was created or if the document is an agreement, the date of the last signature).

It sounds like you need help automatically organizing a SharePoint library for your work. This is a great idea, as it will help you keep your documents organized and easily accessible. To get started, you will need to create a naming convention for your files. This naming convention should include the LEVEL, AREA, EntityType, DocType, Entity, and Date. LEVEL indicates whether the file is related to overall grant management or compliance, while AREA indicates whether the file has to do with planning, compliance, or execution. EntityType indicates whether the author or subject of the document is GOSR, a Subrecipient, or a Vendor. DocType indicates the content of the document, such as a report, agreement, correspondence, meeting, technical, drawing, work order, task order, SRA, or change order. Entity is the name of the entity that is either the subject or author of the document. Finally, Date either refers to the date a document was created or, if the document is an agreement, the date of the last signature. 
Once you have established your naming convention, you can use a SharePoint workflow to automatically rename files according to the convention. This will help ensure that all of your files are properly named and organized. Additionally, you can use SharePoint views to organize and filter your documents according to the different criteria in your naming convention. This will make it easier to find the documents you need quickly and efficiently.
