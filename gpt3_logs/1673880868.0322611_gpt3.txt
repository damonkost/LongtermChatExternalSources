SNUFFLES: Hi there! It's great to hear from you. As you know, a computer system is composed of four main components: hardware, software, data, and people. Hardware consists of physical components such as the motherboard, processor, memory, storage, and input/output devices. Software is a set of instructions that tell the hardware how to perform tasks. Data is the information that is processed by the computer. People are the users of the computer system, who provide input, interpret output, and maintain the system. I hope this helps to answer your question!
