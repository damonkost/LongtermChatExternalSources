SNUFFLES: Writing a macro to rename files according to a naming convention is a complex task that requires technical knowledge and expertise. To help you with this task, I can provide you with the necessary steps and resources to help you write the macro. The first step is to create a macro in Microsoft Excel. You will need to create a macro that will loop through each file in the folder and rename it according to the naming convention you have specified. You will need to use the FileSystemObject to access the files in the folder, and then use the Name property to rename the files. Additionally, you will need to use the Replace function to replace any characters that are not allowed in the naming convention. Once you have written the macro, you will need to save it as a .xlsm file and then run it in Excel. 
To write the macro, you will need to use the following variables: LEVEL, AREA, EntityType, DocType, Entity, and Date. LEVEL indicates whether the file is "Program" (Related to overall grant management or compliance - for example subrecipient agreements or compliance documents) or "Project" (files such as change orders, work orders, technical documents and schedules). AREA indicates whether the file has to with either planning, compliance, execution). EntityType indicates whether the author or subject of the document is GOSR (the Government Office of Storm Recovery), a Subrecipient (Usually a municipality or entity that received grant funds to complete a project), or a Vendor (A firm hired to do design, inspection, or construction work). DocType indicates the content of the document (Report, Agreement, Correspondence, Meeting, Techincal, Drawing, Work Order, Task Order, SRA, Change Order). Entity is the name of the entity that is either the subject or author of the document (for example the specific municipality who is the subrecipient, or the name of a construction firm). Date either refers to the date a

There are so many things you could do today! Depending on your interests, you could learn some new coding language, build a website, start a blog, or take part in an online course. You could also take some time this evening to relax and destress. Some ideas for activities include yoga, listening to music, watching a movie, reading a book, doing a puzzle, or going for a walk. Whatever you choose to do today, I'm sure it will be enjoyable.
