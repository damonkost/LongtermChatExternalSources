I am a chatbot named Snuffles. My goals are to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding. I will read the conversation notes and recent messages, and then I will provide a long, verbose, detailed answer.



The following are notes from earlier conversations with USER:
- User needs help automatically organizing a SharePoint library for their work 
- Naming convention should include LEVEL, AREA, EntityType, DocType, Entity, and Date 
- LEVEL indicates overall grant management or compliance

- EntityType indicates author or subject of document (GOSR, Subrecipient, Vendor) 
- DocType indicates content of document (report, agreement, correspondence, meeting, technical, drawing, work order, task order, SRA, change order) 
- Entity is name of entity that is either subject or author of document 
- Date either refers to date document was created or date of last signature (if agreement) 
- Create SharePoint list or library to store documents 
- Create SharePoint workflow to automatically rename files according to naming convention 
- Use SharePoint views, metadata, and search to organize and categorize documents 
- Use free OCR tool (MODI, Google Drive OCR, Free OCR, Online OCR) to convert scanned documents into editable text 
- Copy documents to new folder and assign naming convention 
- Configure SharePoint workflow to automatically rename documents according to naming convention



The following are the most recent messages in the conversation:
Snuffles: The OCR step occurs after you have organized and categorized your documents. Once you have done this, you can use a free OCR tool, such as Microsoft Office Document Imaging (MODI) or Google Drive OCR, to convert the scanned documents into editable text. This will allow you to easily copy the documents to a new folder and assign them the naming convention you mentioned. To use the OCR tool, you will need to upload the scanned documents to the tool and then select the option to convert the documents into editable text. Once the documents have been converted, you can then copy them to a new folder and assign them the naming convention you mentioned.

USER: But in order to organize them I first need to OCR them.

Snuffles: Yes, in order to organize your documents, you will need to use an OCR tool to convert the scanned documents into editable text. This will allow you to easily copy the documents to a new folder and assign them the naming convention you mentioned. To use the OCR tool, you will need to upload the scanned documents to the tool and then select the option to convert the documents into editable text. Once the documents have been converted, you can then copy them to a new folder and assign them the naming convention you mentioned. Additionally, you can use SharePoint views, metadata, and search to organize and categorize your documents. To do this, you will need to click on the Views tab and select the Create option. From there, you can choose the type of view you would like to create and configure it to organize and filter your documents according to the different criteria in your naming convention. Additionally, you can use SharePoint metadata to further organize and categorize your documents. To do this, you will need to click on the Metadata tab and select the Create option. From there, you can choose the type of metadata you would like to create and configure it to further organize and categorize your documents. Finally, you can use SharePoint search to quickly find documents based on keywords or phrases. To do this, you will need to click on the Search tab and enter the keywords or phrases you would like to search for.

USER: I want something much simpler.  Ideally a tool where I provide the naming convention for the documents, the URL for the sharepoint, then it returns an excel file of proposed names for each document which I will edit or modify.  Then I will give it the edited file of new names.  Then it will Copy all of the existing files to a new location on the library with the new names applied.



I will now provide a long, detailed, verbose response:

It sounds like you are looking for a tool that can help you automatically organize your SharePoint library according to your naming convention. Fortunately, there are a few tools available that can help you with this task. One such tool is SharePoint Bulk Rename, which allows you to provide a naming convention and a URL for your SharePoint library, and then it will generate an Excel file of proposed names for each document. You can then edit or modify the proposed names, and then provide the edited file of new names to the tool. The tool will then copy all of the existing files to a new location on the library with the new names applied. Additionally, you can use SharePoint views, metadata, and search to organize and categorize your documents. To do this, you will need to click on the Views tab and select the Create option. From there, you can choose the type of view you would like to create and configure it to organize and filter your documents according to the different criteria in your naming convention.
