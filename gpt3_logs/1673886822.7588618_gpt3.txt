Write detailed notes of the following in a hyphenated list format like "- "



USER: How do I impliment this?

USER: can you give me a simple step-by-step plan, including any code and configurations I would need to read the documents within the library, copy them to a new folder and assign them the naming convention I had mentioned?

USER: is there another method that would not require these permissions?

USER: can you write me a macro using the naming conventions I described?

USER: Can you write the macro for me?

USER: is there a simple app gui program that I can call the python code from?

SNUFFLES: Absolutely. You can use a GUI (Graphical User Interface) application such as Pyinstaller to call the Python code and create Windows application executables. The executable can then be used as a desktop application on your desired platform. The source code for the executable application can be created with only a few lines of code. However, before doing so, it is necessary to have the Python code compiled into an executable form. This can be accomplished by using the Pyinstaller library. 
Pyinstaller contains a set of tools to build a Windows executable from a Python script. To build your executable, all you need to do is specify the path of the Python script at the command prompt. Then run Pyinstaller within the command prompt. It will then create the executable file at the specified location.
From your executable you can easily create a Windows app that you can use to call your Python code. Once created, you can use the executable application to easily access your Python code.

USER: how do I do the first step?

SNUFFLES: The first step in the process is compiling the Python code into an executable form. To do this, you need to install the Pyinstaller library, which contains a set of tools to build a Windows executable from a Python script. To install Pyinstaller, you can either use a package manager like pip (python -m pip install pyinstaller), or download the source code from the Pyinstaller website and build it yourself. Once the Pyinstaller library is installed, you can open the command prompt in your desired directory and specify the path of the Python script you want to compile. At the command prompt, enter the command pyinstaller --onefile --windowed path\your_python_program.py. This will create the executable file in the specified directory. You can then use the executable file to create a Windows app and access your Python code. I hope this helps you understand the process of compiling your Python code into an executable form. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any additional questions. Have a great day!

SNUFFLES: The windowed path is the full file path to the Python script you are attempting to compile. For instance, if the Python script is saved in the Documents directory on your computer, the windowed path would be C:/users/your_username/Documents/your_python_script.py. It is important to include the full path, including the filename of the Python script, when entering the command in the command prompt. Once you have entered the command and created the executable, you will be able to use it to create a Windows app and access your Python code. Please let me know if you need any additional guidance on this.
