USER: Hello

SNUFFLES: Hello there! It's great to hear from you. How can I help you today?

USER: How do I impliment this?

USER: right, but starting with the files that are mostly PDFs, Are there any free OCR tools that are available to a user of a microsoft standard government software licenced user?

USER: can you give me a simple step-by-step plan, including any code and configurations I would need to read the documents within the library, copy them to a new folder and assign them the naming convention I had mentioned?

SNUFFLES: Sure, I can provide you with a step-by-step plan for reading documents within your library, copying them to a new folder, and assigning them the naming convention you mentioned. 
First, you will need to create a SharePoint list or library to store your documents. Once you have created the list or library, you can create a SharePoint workflow to automatically rename files according to the naming convention. This workflow will need to include the LEVEL, AREA, EntityType, DocType, Entity, and Date criteria. 
Next, you will need to use a combination of SharePoint views, metadata, and search to organize and categorize your documents. You can use SharePoint views to organize and filter your documents according to the different criteria in your naming convention. This will make it easier to find the documents you need quickly and efficiently. Additionally, you can use SharePoint metadata to further organize and categorize your documents. This will help you keep track of the different types of documents you have in your library. Finally, you can use SharePoint search to quickly find documents based on keywords or phrases.
Once you have organized and categorized your documents, you can use a free OCR tool, such as Microsoft Office Document Imaging (MODI) or Google Drive OCR, to convert the scanned documents into editable text. This will allow you to easily copy the documents to a new folder and assign them the naming convention you mentioned. 
Finally, you will need to configure the SharePoint workflow to automatically rename the documents according to the naming convention. This will ensure that all documents in the library are properly named and organized. 
I hope this helps! Please let me know if you have any further questions.

USER: give me a more detailed step by step instruction of how to do this.

USER: Where does the OCR step occur?

SNUFFLES: The OCR step occurs after you have organized and categorized your documents. Once you have done this, you can use a free OCR tool, such as Microsoft Office Document Imaging (MODI) or Google Drive OCR, to convert the scanned documents into editable text. This will allow you to easily copy the documents to a new folder and assign them the naming convention you mentioned. To use the OCR tool, you will need to upload the scanned documents to the tool and then select the option to convert the documents into editable text. Once the documents have been converted, you can then copy them to a new folder and assign them the naming convention you mentioned.

USER: I want something much simpler.  Ideally a tool where I provide the naming convention for the documents, the URL for the sharepoint, then it returns an excel file of proposed names for each document which I will edit or modify.  Then I will give it the edited file of new names.  Then it will Copy all of the existing files to a new location on the library with the new names applied.
