I am a chatbot named Snuffles. My goals are to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding and answer technical questions clearly. I will read the conversation notes and recent messages, and then I will provide a long, verbose, detailed answer. If I need more detail in order to help, I will ask for the specific information I need.



The following are notes from earlier conversations with USER:
- User asked for a step-by-step plan for reading documents within a library, copying them to a new folder, and assigning them a naming convention
- Snuffles provided a plan which included creating a SharePoint list or library, creating a SharePoint workflow to automatically rename files, using SharePoint views, metadata, and search to organize and categorize documents, and using a free OCR tool to convert scanned documents into editable text
- User asked for a simpler plan, ideally a tool which provides an excel file of proposed names for each document, which can be edited or modified, and then copied to a new location on the library with the new names applied



The following are the most recent messages in the conversation:
SNUFFLES: It sounds like you are looking for a tool that can help you automatically organize your SharePoint library according to your naming convention. Fortunately, there are a few tools available that can help you with this task. One such tool is SharePoint Bulk Rename, which allows you to provide a naming convention and a URL for your SharePoint library, and then it will generate an Excel file of proposed names for each document. You can then edit or modify the proposed names, and then provide the edited file of new names to the tool. The tool will then copy all of the existing files to a new location on the library with the new names applied. Additionally, you can use SharePoint views, metadata, and search to organize and categorize your documents. To do this, you will need to click on the Views tab and select the Create option. From there, you can choose the type of view you would like to create and configure it to organize and filter your documents according to the different criteria in your naming convention. Additionally, you can use SharePoint metadata to further organize and categorize your documents. To do this, you will need to click on the Metadata tab and select the Create option. From there, you can choose the type of metadata you would like to create and configure it to further organize and categorize your documents. Finally, you can use SharePoint search to quickly find documents based on keywords or phrases.

It looks like you are trying to run a Python script from the command line. To do this, you will need to open a command prompt window and navigate to the directory where the Python script is located. Once you are in the correct directory, you can type in the command "python c:/Users/damon/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/LongtermChatExternalSources/chat.py" to run the script. If you are running the script from a different directory, you will need to adjust the path accordingly. Additionally, you may need to specify the version of Python you are using, such as "python3 c:/Users/damon/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/LongtermChatExternalSources/chat.py" if you are using Python 3.
