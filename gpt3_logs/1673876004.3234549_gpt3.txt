USER: How do I impliment this?

SNUFFLES: To implement the naming convention and SharePoint workflow, you will need to create a SharePoint list or library to store your documents. Once you have created the list or library, you can create a SharePoint workflow to automatically rename files according to the naming convention. This workflow will need to include the LEVEL, AREA, EntityType, DocType, Entity, and Date criteria. You can also use SharePoint views to organize and filter your documents according to the different criteria in your naming convention. This will make it easier to find the documents you need quickly and efficiently. Additionally, you can use SharePoint metadata to further organize and categorize your documents. This will help you keep track of the different types of documents you have in your library. Finally, you can use SharePoint search to quickly find documents based on keywords or phrases.
